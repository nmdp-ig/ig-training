# Using docker and /etc/hosts to view the published IG
 
I cread a docker image with PHP/Apache with the published
IG files that can be viewed locally.

To be able to see published IG, edit the `/etc/hosts` file and add following
line (MacOS or Linux/Unix)
```
127.0.0.1    example.org
```

Now, when my browser tries to go to example.org, it gets routed to my localhost.

Then to create a docker image (see the Dockerfile), run the following
commands.

First see if a previous container is running, and stop it if it is.
```
$ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE              COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                NAMES
fd767ed9d25c   exampleig:latest   "docker-php-entrypoiâ€¦"   3 hours ago   Up 3 hours   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   agitated_torvalds

$ docker stop agitated_torvalds
```

Now build and run the new docker image.
```
$ docker build -t exampleig:latest .
$ docker run -d -p 80:80 exampleig:latest
```

Point the browser to `http://example.org/ig/exampleig`
